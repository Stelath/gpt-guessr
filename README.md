# ~~COMING SOON~~ Project has been put on hold as Stanford Grad Students have recently released a model called PIGEON which significantly outperforms ours, I suggest you check it out [here](https://twitter.com/lkshaas/status/1657422053031411713), while they haven't released the model yet I expect them to soon, I may revisit this project but for now its closed =(

I'm trying to improve it now, feel free to look around the code, as of writing this (3/31/2023) it's quite accurate, but not good enough for me to release fully yet. I'll try and have a full model up as soon as possible but its going to be a while as I'm currently focused on research and this is more of a side project.
